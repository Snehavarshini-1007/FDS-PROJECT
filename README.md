# Online News Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model for classifying online news articles into different categories. The goal is to build a robust classification system that can automatically assign a category to a given news article based on its content.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to extract relevant features.Includes Tokenization , Stemming and lemmatization of data.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implement and compare different machine learning algorithms for classification.
  
## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK)
